# Windows 7 Start Menu for KDE

A modern and faithful reimplementation of the classic **Windows 7 Start Menu** as a KDE Plasmoid.

This project is a **fork of the DeepinMenu ClassicKDE** (https://store.kde.org/p/2180887), with significant modifications to reproduce the look and behavior of the Windows 7 Start Menu. It was developed to provide a more nostalgic and functional experience within the KDE Plasma desktop environment.
